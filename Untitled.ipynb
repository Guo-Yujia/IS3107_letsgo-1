       "  '(Disclosure: I have been provided this product to test with the understanding that I will write a product review that is accurate and completely honest.) As I age, I have concerns about maintaining a youthful level of testosterone. While I do not suffer from ED or low libido, there are many other reasons that men would want to insure adequate and healthy testosterone production, muscle-body fat ratio, bone density, brain health, etc. One of the drawbacks to many low-T therapies is hair loss. When I looked at the list of ingredients in this product I saw “pumpkin seed powder” which helps prevent the conversion of testosterone to DHT which contributes to hair loss. I looked at the other ingredients and was familiar nearly all the ingredients, having most of them already in my vitamin cabinet in some form or another. Based on that I figured I would give this product a try. The first day I took the product, within hours I felt like I’d swallowed a fistful of guarana capsules - I was zooming. I did not think much about it or even relate it to taking the product. By day 4 I became alarmed as I nearly no sleep for the previous three nights. I went back to ingredients list of the product and saw a name I did not recognize, Tongkat Ali - the main ingredient. I googled side effects for Tongkat Ali (which goes by many different names) and found it under the name EURYCOMA LONGIFOLIA on WebMD. While there was nothing to suggest that there is anything wrong with using the herb, I did read that sleeplessness is one possible side effect. I went back to the product bottle, and it is listed there as a reason to discontinue use, I immediately stopped taking it for the rest of the week. I decided I would start again in one week, but drop the dose to half, a single pill per day and see if that would be different. Unfortunately I had the same speedy, sleepless reaction to even half a dose. While I can find nothing wrong with the product or its ingredients via Google searches, it seems like it may not be for people like me who are highly reactive to drug in general. And like any supplement, read the warning label on the product before using.',\n",

When applying this product you notice that the consistency isn't like your typical cream, but it goes on the skin like butter, gliding through nicely.  It also absorbs well into the skin keeping it hydrated.  The reason that I give this product a 4 is because I felt that it didn't really hydrate my skin for 8-12 hours like it says on the description.  I felt that I kept having to reapply the cream multiple times per day, and because of this I ran out of the product quickly.

They think that cacao has the highest of magnesium and antioxidants , high in fiber and many other healthy attribute. Even though Cocoa is possessed at a higher heat and from a different part of the some bean as cacao, it still retains a huge amount of the same nutritional values.  I haven't had the chance to make any recipes that allow the cacao.  but I have added it to a few things that really set it off.. We made brownies the other night and added  bit to those.. It made them super, super chocolaty. I also took a que from a website where I learned about the beans where it was talking about making adding it to coffee.. I added a heaping spoonful to my coffee that I brewed in my french press. It was a bit too chocolaty, so the next one I added half a spoonful. Perfect.. I add creamer and sugar to my coffee, so it turned it into the perfect mocha, just right…. YUM! I will be using cacao instead of coco from now on.

I already had a tens machine but needed pads and I love these butterfly pads. I love the way that they distribute electrodes in different areas. These pads are definitely well worth giving a shot. Great for all kinds of pain in different areas of your body. I even use these on my daughter who gets foot pain because of flat feet and being an avid gymnast and cheerleader.\",\n",

       "  \"This is my first vapor device and I'm very happy with it and the $41 price I paid to get it. I have seen the price on these clones anywhere form $41 to $100 for the entire unit.<br /><br />So I would really check out the costs to make sure your not paying top dollar for your device.<br />What I like about it:<br />It's built very well and seems like it could survive a accidental drop<br />It has a huge tank that's simple to fill once you check out a youtube video to learn how if your new to these devices.<br />Huge powerful battery, with 4 different output voltages that allow larger hits if that what you want.<br />Charges fully in about 4 hours.<br />Does not leak any juice into your mouth which really is gross!<br />Seems like it will last a long time with a replaceable battery.<br />Has a optional LED flashlight that can be added to the battery for a very powerful flashlight.<br />Can add any 510 thread tank!<br />Has a two color battery power indicator that cheaper vaps do not have. This one will light up white with a full charge and light up blue when the charge is in the 30% left range. (Great feature that I have not seen on my friends $35 unit)<br />On/Off is as simple as pushing the power button 5 times within two seconds and it works well.<br /><br />Seeing that this is my first purchase of a vap device that I use for nicotine addiction I'm smoking less real cigs from 2 packs a day down to one.<br /><br />This for me is going to hopefully help me quit smoking all together. However, in the mean time this will give me the hand to mouth addiction in a way that does not harm my lungs like real smoke will.<br /><br />If you want a good vapor pen this is a really good one and my best friend who has bought several of these is now buying this one based on how great it is. So the experience I lack is made up with my friends and he thinks this is a excellent vapor device and will be buying one very soon.\",\n",

       "  'Wow!! These are the cutest and the just the perfect sized clips I ever purchased for my little gal! Love love love the awesome colors that the clips come in. These clips came in a very smart and translucent zip pouch, perfect for storing the clips especially if you are short on storage space. These clips are perfect for small babies. I stumbled upon these clips as I have a 9 month old who has yummy hair which keeps sliding over her eyes. I love her hair and did not want to trim it, also, I do not want it getting in the way while she is busy getting the hand of crawling all over the house. A few things I loved about these clips are that the flowers are made with a very high quality satin ribbon. The material used in making the flowers and the use of vibrant colors ensures the classic look of these clips! The small pearl stuck to the center of the flower just takes the brilliance of these clips to another level. What I really liked about the clips was the fact that part of the clips, the top part and the actual part where you hold the clip to put on or take off is also covered in a ribbon of the same color as the flowers giving the clip a finished classy look. Also, the ribbon where you hold the clip is textured to ensure ease of use and prevents the clip from accidentally sliding off from your hands while you are attempting to put it on or take it off! Very thoughtful indeed! The clip itself is not an alligator clip and at times slides off if not put on correctly, but would I rather it slide off than cling on to a few strands of dear daughters hair and put her in pain. All in all, I love the range of colors and the quality of clips and I am sure that they will last us a long while! I will definitely return to purchase more if the need arises! Disclaimer: I was one of the lucky few who was able to get an opportunity to purchase the clips at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion. Yay for that!

I got it a week before we moved across the country, and with all the expenses of the move we couldn't afford to send me for a professional massage. However, this stick helped immensely as a substitute. You wouldn't think a stick could help much, but it really does. The rollers on it have some ridges, which allow for extra pressure points to be hit. The handles have grips for easy handling, both by yourself or by someone using it on you. It's a very basic concept. You roll it up and down the sore area, adjusting the pressure as desired. Simple, yet effective. A lot of areas you can use this on yourself, but for your back and stuff it's more effective  for someone else to help you out. This is a great product that will bring you muscle tension relief!

       "  \"I've covered a couple of different bathroom scales on here, and most of them have been fairly basic. I have one from Ozeri that measures body fat, bone, muscle and water levels too. I'm very happy with it. One even had it's own &#34;app&#34;. But until now, I'd not had one with bluetooth. In steps Taylor, a Salter Housewares brand, with their Taylor Smart Scale with Bluetooth, model 7222F.<br /><br />It has the fairly standard tempered glass surface, this time with stainless steel strips inlaid for the measuring of all those extra metrics like body fat, body water and muscle mass. And it then beams those numbers via bluetooth to your paired smartphone or tablet via their SmarTrack app. At least in theory, that is, because I could not get the app to register me, despite multiple tries on my phone, tablet, and over both our FiOS wifi and 4G network connection. Which, essentially, renders the features that most folks paid extra for useless. Shame. The idea behind easy and convenient tracking of your weight, and your fitness, is a good one, but one of these days these companies really need to understand app development and that it's more than throwing a few dollars at an IT company that bid the lowest to cobble together what amounts to placeholder to be able to say you &#34;have an app&#34;. It has to work, people.<br /><br />Okay. Deep breath.<br /><br />Aside from the incredible amount of frustration caused by this, the scale in and of itself is accurate, and while the numbers were slightly off from the other body fat-measuring scales we have here in the house, that can simply be chalked up to the fact that they all use &#34;estimates&#34; from small electrical signals sent through the body, and so many factors can skew that, I'm not going to begrudge a scale a few percentage points here and there. Up to 8 people can use this scale with basic non-bluetooth tracking features, an &#34;athlete&#34; setting for those that work out regularly, and a bright, dual-line backlit LCD readout with &#34;touchscreen&#34; controls. All this and it operates on 3 AAA batteries. Unfortunately, most of the advertised features like true tracking, cloud storage, and compatibility with MapMyFitness, RunKeeper and other popular apps are inaccessible due to the native app being useless. So it quickly becomes less and less a value because, let's face it, you paid for those features. I wanted to like this product so much more, and I've had Taylor, Salter, and Homedics scales before that were fantastic. This scale is, as a scale, flawless. It's all the advertised extras that caused the premium pricetag that are rendered useless by a non-functioning, junk app. For that reason, I find that I can't, at full retail, recommend this product, because so many of the potentially wonderful features advertised cannot be accessed, and they're built into the price tag. Too bad.<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from Taylor Precision Products.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.

       "  \"The short story - This worked remarkably well for clearing a nasty case of eczema.<br /><br />The long story - For the past three and a half years I have been battling a particularly stubborn case of eczema on my hands.  It's always hard when it's on your hands because every day tasks become tortuously painful due to all the splits in your skin that develop.  I like to use natural cures, when possible, and had tried various things like coconut oil and an elimination diet (I had hopes of identifying something that I was eating that might be causing the problem.)  No real, lasting help came from any of those.  In desperation, I finally sought out a dermatologist who immediately wanted to give me the dreaded steroid shot.  I declined that so she gave me clobetasol propitiante.  This was a very expensive ointment and while it did help to knock the eczema back somewhat, it failed to completely clear it and it would always come roaring back after I stopped using it.  (I was only allowed to use it for 14 days, maximum.)  The last time I went to refill the prescription, the druggest said it would cost $200 for a tube.  Knowing that it would provide only partial and temporary relief, I decided to come to amazon instead and see if I could find anything that was getting good reviews.  Fortunately, I found e-ra oranics Relief.<br /><br />I started using it and the less damaged areas of my hands began to show improvement within just a few days.  I was surprised, but cautiously optimistic.  I continued to use it for several weeks, continuing to see improvement.  However, there was one particularly stubborn area on the outer edge of my hand and in toward my palm that just would not budge.  It had several splits and even when I babied it and kept it covered as much as possible, it just continued to split open on me day after day.  I wondered if I'd ever see improvement.  I knew if I could just get it to stop breaking open like that, I'd be able to improve.  I continued applying the era organics Relief, and finally!  It healed enough that the skin stopped breaking open in splits.  My hands are now about 98% normal, and that has been after nearly 3 1/2 years of constant torment.<br /><br />I'm on my fourth jar, but even at that I've only spent half of what that prescription would have cost me AND, the most important thing, I actually have been healed.  I'm so thankful and so amazed.  If you have ever had a severe attack of eczema, you know how miserable the itch is.  Sometimes it feels like you'll lose your mind scratching to stop the itch.  And then of course, all that scratching just damages your skin even more.  Then, as I said, there are the painful splits that make every day tasks like washing your hands a painful proposition.  My fingers had actually curled in somewhat, like claws.  It was BAD.  And it had made my life pretty miserable for a very long time.  So I can't thank the folks at Era Organics enough.  I will continue using this until I'm 100% healed and I will always keep some on hand, should a rash try to creep back.<br /><br />Btw, I very much like the feel of the cream.  It has a silky quality and is not greasy at all.<br /><br />If you or someone you love suffers with eczema, please give this a try and leave a comment in reply to my post to let me know how it helped you.<br /><br />In addition, I'd like to suggest anybody with a child or who is themself dealing with eczema read a very informative book by Dr. William Crook called, The Yeast Connection.  Between those two sources, you ought to find some relief.  Good luck!, and finally!  It healed enough that the skin stopped breaking open in splits.

The nasal pillows has been my least favorite. I require a CPAP machine since I have serious nasal congestion. This results in loud snoring through both my mouth and my nose (with my mouth closed), plus I often stop breathing entirely for long periods while sleeping. (Interestingly enough, I feel more rested in the morning without the CPAP machine. But I am required to use it most of the time.)<br /><br />This is a three piece mask. The plastic frame, plus the plastic mask itself, and the cushion around the mask. All three pieces are together in this kit. The harness is extra. The recommended head harness for this mask works, but does not fit a person's head perfectly when using this mask.<br /><br />I need the large mask since my nostrils will sometimes close up while I sleep and I will start breathing through my mouth. This allows my mouth to breath air in/out below the length of a regular normal size mask. I have the large size of this mask, which is what I needed.<br /><br />However, here is the problem that I sometimes run into with this mask. The mask will marginally slip to one side and escaping air will dry out one of my eyes. This results in a very bad day for that eye for most of that day. Occasionally an eye wash will help with this, but not always. (A condition that I am experiencing as I type this review.)<br /><br />As I said, I have not found the perfect CPAP mask yet.

Just what i want to be visualizing while getting ready to floss.  The case was easy to click open, which was great considering some other brands are very difficult to open.  I hate breaking nails trying to open packaging.  The smell of this floss is very pleasant not too strong and over powering, just the right amount of mintiness.  Pulling the floss out of the case was a little difficult the wheel was sticking and was hard to pull the floss out without a bit of effort.  I might have gotten a defective one though.  When i got the floss out it was very nice and ribbon like.  I also love how it stretches, because i hate when floss breaks when flossing and this will help prevent it.  Flossing with this was a breeze.  I have a few crowns and floss always gets stuck under them this got under them without getting stuck but still cleaning that area well.  I love how it just glides between my teeth without me tugging and puling and breaking the floss.  I only need one string of floss to get through my entire mouth!  My 7yr old son also tried it out and loved the taste and it was easy for him to maneuver throughout his mouth without a problem as well.  He said you guys need to make floss stick with this floss because he likes it so much!  Overall it's a great floss just need to fix some of the packaging issue.

The hinge broke in about a week. second the post screws are 2 different screws, the positive uses a philips while the negative runs a n allen key, I see now reason for this, and makes building on this tougher than it should. the post holes are way to small for a 'competition device' and they are not lined up at the same level. lastly the screws do not have enough thread if using large wire, like 22g or 20g.<br /><br />I would recommend going with an actual Mutation X, this thing does hit great and makes lots of clouds and decent flavor, but the design/build quality is of something that the worst clones are made of.\",\n",

This is a great alternative pain reliever. My husband really likes it.<br /><br />I think the only improvement would be if they could make this larger sized self massager fold up. It's pretty big, but its so that you can get the right leverage on the trigger points. The only issue is &#34;where do I put this thing?&#34; It doesn't really have a storage option since it doesn't fold. Right now ours just lays around the house, but I dislike that and would prefer to find a place for it to live. If it folded up that would be even better. Folded in half it would easily fit under a sink or in a closet when not in use.<br /><br />Of course if you're constantly needing to use a self massaging tool like this for pain relief then you may not find it necessary to have it folded up when not in use. It really is a very 'handy' item to have around.<br /><br />Im a massage addict and sometimes my family gets sick of giving me back rubs, so then I have to resort to my own methods and this seems to do the trick for those times when I really need a muscle released.\",\n",

He had warned me that breastfeeding would continue to cause my body to produce relaxin hormones, so I was prepared for the pain to come and go.

I am SO ELATED that I did!! I wore it for at least 10 hours on the first day and when I went to bed at night, I felt so much better. The next day, I was literally pain free.

The quality of the dilators won't blow your mind; they're made out of a sturdy plastic. Fortunately, there are no seams on the dilators, so no worries about sharp edges. Unfortunately, the plastic tends to made loud clanking noises in the bag, which ruins most attempts to be discrete. They don't stack into each other perfectly to fix this, so you might find yourself packing some loose material into the storage back to prevent the dilators from clanking. Certainly a minor issue, but could be annoying for some.<br /><br />They're not expandable, but I believe that 6 is a good balance for gradual increase in diameter. The user must take responsibility to use them gradually and consistently, and that's how it should be. This will be a simple and effective tool for those who want to work on stretching out, but haven't had much success with fingers / vibrators after several attempts.

It runs fairly quietly & I like the color options on it & that I can turn them off also when I don't want the mood lighting. Another nice feature is that it has several time options to chose from or you can just set it to run (which is what I do most of the time) because it automatically turns off.<br /><br />I did take off one star for a few minor things that if changed would have made this perfect for me:<br />1) it does beep when it shuts off, which isn't too loud & hasn't really annoyed me yet but if you use it at night & are a light sleeper it might be enough to wake you<br />2) it is kind of stiff to put the lid on correctly, the lid fits over the base with water just fine but once you have it on it takes a bit more force than I think it should to try to get the arrows to line up at the bottom, it's gotten stuck a few times & it's been difficult to try to adjust while also trying not to slosh water around the inside.<br /><br />All in all though I like this diffuser way better than the other one that we have and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a larger volume diffuser!in all though I like this diffuser way better than the other one that we have and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a larger volume diffuser!\",\n",

I would have needed at least an XL for this to work.)<br /><br />Other Notes:<br />-I already had a belly band that I used during pregnancy, and I was able to use that instead of this girdle-type band (saving about $80)\",\n",

Within the first week, my skin was looking A LOT better and smoother. Of course there's just one downside. This thing really smells. It doesn't smell good, but it doesn't smell horrible either.

       "  \"My daughter just started getting eczema so we've been looking for a cream that will soothe the irritated areas. This cream seems to do that - not as well as the prescription stuff, but this does work. I like how natural the ingredients are. It absorbs quickly, takes the scaliness away (with multiple uses), and feels good on the skin. I don't have eczema, but we live in an extremely dry climate which makes daily application of lotion a necessity. I prefer this cream to the big name brands I've used for years - the scent isn't overpowering and it's moisturizing without being greasy.<br /><br />I also like that Era Organics is a family owned company - they seem to care about their customers and they want you to like the product. They are open to answering questions and listen to your feedback. You really have nothing to lose with their 60 day money back guarantee. This is such a nice moisturizer that I can't imagine many people return it due to dissatisfaction with the results. My daughter and I have very different skin - and we're both very happy with it! Yes, it's a little on the expensive side, but the container is a good size. You don't need to use gobs of the cream to get results, and from what I've read, the ingredients are much higher quality than most drugstore brands.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Great stuff for the skin. It's long lasting, feels good, and the ingredients are soothing. Whether you have eczema, overly dry skin, some other various skin condition, or healthy skin you just want to keep moist and healthy, give this a try. I bet you'll be as happy with it as we are!\",\n",
